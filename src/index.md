![Julio Barba](pics/selfie.avif =300x400)

Hi, and welcome to my personal site! I'm an experienced Software Engineer who has had the opportunity to work on a bunch of cool and interesting projects throughout my career. On this site, you can find some of my most relevant work.

I have 10 years of experience in the design, coding, testing, telemetry and performance optimization of back-end systems, and command line programs. I'm experienced in Source Control, Pull Request and CI (Continuous Improvement) systems.

I'm currently working in the Image and Video Compression fields, and collaborating with other smart developers to improve the state-of-the-art in AV1 and AVIF encoding.
