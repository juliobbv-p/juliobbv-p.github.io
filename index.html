<p>Hi, and welcome to my personal site! I'm an experienced Software Engineer who has had the opportunity to work on a bunch of cool and interesting projects throughout my career. On this site, you can find some of my most relevant work.</p>
<p>I have 10 years of experience in the design, coding, testing, telemetry and performance optimization of back-end systems, and command line programs. I'm experienced in Source Control, Pull Request and CI (Continuous Improvement) systems.</p>
<p>I'm currently working in the Image and Video Compression fields, and collaborating with other smart developers to improve the state-of-the-art in AV1 and AVIF encoding.</p>
